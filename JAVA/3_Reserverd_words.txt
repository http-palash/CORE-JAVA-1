1.void

-> delete keyword is not their in JAVA garbage collector is used to free allocated space by program
-> In JAVA return type is mandatory if method doesnt return anything we have to declare that method
   void return type but in C language return type is optional under default return type is int 

Unused keywords : [2]

1.goto
-> usage of goto  create several problems in old languages so some people banned use of goto in JAVA

2.const
-> to define constants we have final keyword already in JAVA

goto and const are unused keywords and if we trying to use we will get compile time error



Reserved iterals [3]

1. null
2. false
3. true

null - default value for object reference

true, false - value for boolean datatypes


last keyword enum (1.5 version)

-> used to defune group of named constants


enum Month{
    JAN, FEB, MAR, APR, MAY, JUN, JUL, AUG, SEP, OCT, NOV, DEC;
}

Conclusions :

1.  All 53 Reserved words in JAVA contains only lowercase alphabet symbols
2.  In JAVA we have only new keyword and there is no delete keyword in JAVA 
    because destruction of useless object is responsibilty of garbage collector
3.  strictfp(1.2v), assert(1.4v), enum(1.5v) the following are new keywords in java 

4.  variations

    strictfp but not strictFp
    instanceof but not instanceof
    synchronized but not synchronize
    extends but not extend 
    implements but not implement
    import but not imports
    const but not constant

b.  goto, constant                   [x]  const but not constants
c.  break, continue, return, exit    [x]  exit is method not reserved word 
d.  final, finally, finalize         [x]  finalize is a method 
e.  throw, throws, thrown            [x]  thrown is not a keyword
f.  notify, notifyall                [x]  notify and notifyall are methods not keywords 
g.  implements, extends, imports     [x]  import but not imports 
h.  sizeof, instanceof               [x]  sizeof is not there in Java
i.  instanceOf, strictFp             [x]  O and F are capital
j.  byte, short, Int                 [x]  Int I capital    
k.  None of the above                [ ]  

6.  Which of the following are java reserved words 
    
    public [valid]
    static [valid]
