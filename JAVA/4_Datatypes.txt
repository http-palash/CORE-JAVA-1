3.Datatypes 
    
a. Every variable and Every expression in java has some type  
    
    Without type there is  no chance of existing single variable or expression
    
b. Each and every datatype is clearly strictly defined in JAVA

    eg - byte (8 bits) range -128 - +127

    Each and every assignment should be checked by compiler for type compatibility 
    eg : int x = 10.5;  [invalid in java valid in c]
         boolean b = 0; [invalid in java valid in c]


c. Because of above reason we can conclude java is strongly typed programming language


d. JAVA is pure object oriented or not 

   As compare to old languages like c++ java has more object oriented nature 
if considering relative comparision java is pure object oriented program language 
But consider java alone n number of object oriented features are not supported by java
operator overloading, multiple inheritance is not here in java  
still depends on primitive datatype

Ans d.  JAVA is not considered as pure object oriented programming language because several oops
        features are not supported/satisfied by JAVA like operator overloading multiple 
        inheritance etc moreover we are depending on primitive datatype which are not objects

        int x = 10;
