1.1 Identifiers : 

A name in java program is called Identifier which can be used for Identification purpose.
It can be class name, method name, variable name, label-name.


class Test{
    public static void main(String[] args){
        int x = 10;
    }
}

Identifiers are : {/Test /main /String /args /x }


While defining Identifiers in java there are some rules 

1.  The only allowed characters in java Identifiers are (a to z) (A to Z) (0 to 9) ($) ( _ )
   
    If we used other characters we will get compile time error 
    Example : total_number [valid]  total#number [invalid]

2.  Identifiers cant start with digit.

    Example : total123 [valid]  123total [invalid]

3.  Java is case sensitive programming Language also java Identifiers are case sensitive.

    We can differentiate Identifiers with respect to case.

    class{
        int num = 10;
        int Num = 20;
        int NUM = 30;
    }

4.  There is no length limit for java Identifiers but it is not recommended to use to lonmg Identifiers 
    because readability of code goes down.
   
5.  We cant use Reserved words as Identifiers 

    Example : int x = 10 [valid]      int if = 20 [invalid]

6.  All predefine class names and interfaces names in java can be used as identifiers even though
    it is valid but it is not a good programming practice because it reduces readability and creates 
    confusion.

    Example : int String = 888; 
              int Runnable = 999;

              
Question : Which are the following are valid identifiers

_number      [valid]
total_number [valid]
total#       [invalid]
123total     [invalid]
total123     [valid]
ca$h         [valid]
_$_$_$_$_    [valid]
all@hands    [invalid]
Java2share   [valid]
Integer      [valid]
Int          [valid]
int          [invalid]
